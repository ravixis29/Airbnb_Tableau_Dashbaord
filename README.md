# Airbnb_Tableau_Dashbaord

I have made this project using Kaggle dataset. This project is related to Airbnb Report. 
I uncovered fascinating trends e.g. average prices of rooms by zipcode, all beautifully represented in intuitive dashboards and on Map also. The revenue times series graph highlights the dynamic nature of the short-term rental market.
The dashboard also includes the no. of listings and average price as per the bedroom number(i.e. 1,2 or multiple bedrooms).

You can find the dashboad at below link-
